## Summary

Enumerations in Dart are very looks like Classes

Classes are dynamic in Dart, You can also use constructors to create instances.

But, Enumerations are hardcoded, thier instances are pre-defined in the code.

Tips:

When defining enhanced enumerations, first use the 'class' keyword and define the properties and methods of the enumeration.

Afterwards, change to the 'enum' keyword and define the value of the enumeration
